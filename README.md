# Java 8 Features

## What about

This is a little maven project just to explore a little bit more the new features that were included in the version 8 of java.

### Functional Stuff

One of the most curious things that java 8 give us is new syntax sugar for functional programming. The ability to explicitly declare functional interfaces is a plus to reduce the verbosity of code. You've got a [blog post](https://codecorner.balhau.net/2016/02/20/decorate-and-factory/) that tackles the building of fluent interfaces and use code you'll find here for that purpose

### Chaining techniques

Here you'll find *SillyMockServer* which is a demonstration how you can use chaining to build a custom DSL. You'll find more information in a [blog post](https://codecorner.balhau.net/2016/08/20/chaining-patterns/) dedicated to this specific matter.


###More in due time

More stuff will be appended to this repo as soon as new things are experimented...
