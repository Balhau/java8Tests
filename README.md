#Java 8 Features

##What about

This is a little maven project just to explore a little bit more the new features that were included in the version 8 of java.

###Functional Stuff

One of the most curious things that java 8 give us is new syntax sugar for functional programming. The ability to explicitly declare functional interfaces is a plus to reduce the verbosity of code.


###More in due time

More stuff will be appended to this repo as soon as new things are experimented...
